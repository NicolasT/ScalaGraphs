===========
ScalaGraphs is an implementation of inductive graphs and functional graph
algorithms as described in the research by Martin Erwig and others [1]_.

The project was started by `Nicolas Trangez`_ to get acquainted with the
`Scala programming language`_ and functional data structures in general.
